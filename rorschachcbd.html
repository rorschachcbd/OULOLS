	<div id="about-me">
	<h2>Who are you?</h2>
	<p>My name is Cody Duncan, and I am a Physics student, currently at university. I enjoy playing computer games in my spare time, and watching other people play them the rest of the time. I am also currently trying to write a screenplay/novel (not entirely sure which one I want to do yet). I enjoy listening to copious amounts of music.</p>

	<h2>05/02/2013 - Modest Beginnings</h2>
	<p>In some ways, this has been a long time in the making. I've always wanted to set up a blog, not really about me, but about all the random shit that goes on in my head on a daily basis. Problem was, I not only lacked the knowledge of how to set up a blog on my own website, but I also lacked both the impetus and interesting lives most bloggers have.
	I now have at least the first 2 of these things. This site will essentially be dedicated to things that I love, and a place for me to nerd the fuck out.</p>

	<h2>06/02/2013 - Escher is a Bastard</h2>
	<p>So I bought the fantastic 'Antichamber' yesterday, and played it for about 5 minutes before my mind went into to meltdown. That game is both immensely fun and incredibly difficult, not in terms of actual game play mechanics, but in terms of actually figuring out what the hell is going on. The graphics are gorgeous and the puzzles brilliant, yet there is always this feeling that you are missing something incredibly simple when you can't solve the problems. At which point you pick up your computer and smash it to pieces, if you get frustrated easily. Not that I do that. Much. If you haven't played it, or at least seen someone play it, you are honestly missing out.</p>
